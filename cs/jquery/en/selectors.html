<p>Selectors is one of the most important issues in the use of jQuery. There are many different ways to select an element from the DOM, but that doesn&#39;t mean they have the same performance, you can select an element using classes, IDs or methods like <code>find()</code>, <code>children()</code>.</p>
<p>Among all of them, select an ID is the fastest one, because its based on a native DOM operation:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">"#foo"</span>);
</code></pre>
